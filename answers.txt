1.
Array access:
    O(1)/constant
Add/remove from beginning of array:
    O(n)/linear with respect to the size of the array.
    All elements must be shifted.
Add/remove from end of array:
    O(1)/constant, assuming the storage allocation does not need expanding.

2.
Extend dynamic array size:
    O(n)/linear.
    Allocate new space, copy each element

3.
What does a node do if it gets a message from another in the network with a new block?
    Validate the proof contained to check that it matches, then begin the next block.

4.
Why can't someone cheat by changing a transaction from an earlier block?
    This will change the hash of that block. They would then have to re-validate
    that block and all subsequent to the current blocks and generate proofs
    before a proof for the current block can be generated.
